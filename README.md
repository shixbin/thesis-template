You can add `thesis` to your version control system to track your own changes.
Changes to the thesis template can be pulled from `thesis-template` directory.

If you use a different location for `thesis-template`, modify `link-template` accordingly.

Prepare the following files in directory `thesis/body`.
- config.tex
- abstract.tex
- main.tex
- bibs.tex
- ack.tex

`\cite` is redefined to generate two citation formats:
- For the required citation format of "([n], Author, Year: Page.)", use `\cite[Page]{Name}` (e.g. `\cite[24]{JaffarYZ07}`).
- For inline text citation format of "Author (Year)", use `\cite{Name}` as normal (e.g. `\cite{JaffarYZ07}`).

Source code listings should be less than 70 columns in width for best display quality.
